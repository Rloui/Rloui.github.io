Diretions 

// You have a deck of 28 cards with seven sets of 4, numbers matching

// You take those cards and deal 6 piles of 4 cards

// You take the last 4 and put those in the middle

// Then the game begins

// User selects a deck and files the deck upside down

// User compares cards in hand to the cards to chose from if they want a card then they select the card that they want to trade and the card they want from the middle and they switch

// User does this as many times as they want for the cards in their hand 

// When the user is done they put that hand face down and then they move on and repeat it with the next hand 

// When the user has a match they put the cards back down and flip it up

// When all the decks are faced up they put tap all the decks and say stress and they win the game
